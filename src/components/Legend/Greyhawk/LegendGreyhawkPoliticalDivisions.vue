    <legend-link>Prelacy of Almor</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Originally a clerical fief of <legend-link>Aerdy</legend-link>, Almor grew in power and
    independence as the <legend-link>Great Kingdom</legend-link> became weak and decadent. The
    various petty nobles and the Lord Mayor of the town of <legend-link>Innspa</legend-link> swear
    allegiance to the reigning prelate - usually a high priest. The state is only loosely organized,
    but it has a strong spirit of freedom and justice based upon religious pre- cepts. The peoples
    are mainly farmers and herdsmen and fisherfolk. In the far north there are some fore- sters.
    Militia contingents bear crossbow, spear or polearm (fauchard or glaive most commonly), or
    longbow or battleaxe (northern contingent). Standing forces number around 5,000 total horse and
    foot, plus the nobility and gentry. The Prelacy is strongly sup- ported by
    <legend-link>Nyrond</legend-link> as a buffer between that realm and that of the
    <em>Overking</em>, and pays a stipend to help sup- port the standing army of Almor.

    <legend-link>Bandit Kingdoms</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Bandit Kingdoms are a collection of petty holdings which were founded sometime around
    300-330 CY. This collection of small personal territories stretches from the southern
    <legend-link>Shield Lands</legend-link> to the <legend-link>Bluff Hills</legend-link> and
    northern verges of the <legend-link>Fellreev Forest</legend-link>, from the
    <legend-link>Ritensa River</legend-link> to the <legend-link>Artonsamay River</legend-link> in
    the east. Each little kingdom is ruled by a robber chieftain claiming a title such as Baron,
    Boss, Plar, General, Tyrant, Prince, Despot, and even King. The territorial boundaries of the
    holdings of these kinglets are subject to rapid change due to sudden warfare and defeat or
    victory. In all, there are 17 states within the confines of the area, ruled by four to six
    powerful lords, with the rest attempting either to become leading rulers or simply to survive.
    The relationship persists because no single bandit lord is strong enough to conquer the whole
    territory, and the combined strength of all is often required to defend against neighboring
    states’ retributive expeditions. So bandit and brigand band together in self interest, and no
    kinglet, regardless of ambition, has seriously attempted to rule the whole, for fear that
    threatened lords would turn to neighboring states in spite even at the risk of destruction by
    the summoned “ally.” Thus the combined kinglets continue to stand more or less together. The
    total military strength of all territories is quite considerable due to the fact that each ruler
    maintains a large force with which to raid and pillage. (There probably are some 10,000 regular
    troops in total, if recent reconnaissance is to be trusted.)

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="bissel" />
    <legend-link>March of Bissel</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Lirtlemark, or March of Bissel, was the northernmost frontier of the kingdom of Keoland, c.
    400 CY. It was wrested from the latter in the Small War (Furyondy vs. Keoland) which ended
    Keoish influence in Veluna (438 CY). Bissel became a tributary state of Furyondy for a few
    decades, but when humanoid invasions swept over the latter realm, the Margrave Rollo established
    the independence of the territory by bravery in service of the King of Furyondy (the Bisselites
    slaughtered a horde of Jebli (goblins) which lay in ambush for King Hugh III, who was guarded by
    but a small train.) The King granted the brave Rollo palatinate status for the deeds performed,
    and Bissel has enjoyed self-rule since. The March now stands as a bulwark between the Ket masses
    and the rest of the east. It likewise guards Keoland and the south. Because of its strategic
    position, both Furyondy-Veluna and Keoland now support the principality, and adventurers and
    mercenaries from all of the Flanaess can be found in the ranks of the “Border Companies” which
    comprise the standing army of the Margrave. There are four regular companies and four reserve
    companies; each is 1,000 strong and contains contingents of horse, foot and archers. Favored
    weapons are the lance, crossbow, pike, fauchard-fork, flail, and sword. Bisselite soldiers are
    very well equipped and well-armored. Each company has a special squad of scouts (numbering 30 to
    50) attached when on border duty.

    <legend-link>Blackmoor</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This little-known territory exists between the fierce nomads to the south and the terrible Land
    of Black Ice to the north, protected by the cold marshes and the dangerous Icy Sea, as well as
    the vast stretches of the Burneal Forest. It is reported that hot springs and volcanism keep the
    area habitable, and that monsters teem in its wildernesses of brush and marsh. The original
    capital, Blackmoor, and its castle were sacked and ruined some years ago, but extensive
    labyrinths are supposed to exist under these ruins. There also is purported to be a strange
    “City of the Gods” somewhere within the Archbarony. Inhabitants of the area employ slings, bows
    (short), and spears. Cavalry is uncommon, except in the force of the ruler.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="bone-march" />
    <legend-link>Bone March</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    When the <legend-link>Kingdom of Aerdy</legend-link> became an empire, its leaders determined to
    crush the troublesome barbarians pushing down from the Thillonrian Peninsula and settling in the
    strip of land between the Rakers and Grendep Bay. Being indifferent sailors, the Aerdians opted
    to attack overland, and began sending strong parties northward to drive the invaders from the
    north back to their homeland. After many sharp skirmishes, a large contingent of imperial troops
    was routed, and full-scale warfare began.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Fruztii tribes had retreated before the Aerdians, but sent out calls for their kin, and
    these doughty fighters poured down by land and sea for the prospect of battle and loot. Over
    10,000 assembled and attacked the works under construction at Spinecastle. A relief force fought
    a pitched battle with these barbarians, most of whom were slain – along with several thousand
    imperial soldiers. The newly won fief was named for the remains of this struggle, the Battle of
    the Shamblefield, or Caldni Vir’s Charge. In 560 CY hordes of humanoids (Euroz, Kell, Eiger, and
    others) began making forays into the Bone March, and these raids turned into a full scale
    invasion the next year. In 563 the land fell to these invaders, its lord was slain, and its army
    slain or enslaved. Humans in the area were likewise enslaved or killed, and the whole territory
    is now ruled by one or more of the humanoid chiefs. Exact information is not available. The
    humanoids gained access to the area by moving through the mountains, and now use these trails to
    raid the Pale, Ratik, and even Nyrond – although any movement through the Flinty Hills is at
    great peril due to the gnomes still holding out there. There is continual border warfare along
    the Teesar Torrent and in the Blemu Hills of Aerdy’s North Province, although some say that the
    Overking would gladly make peace with the humanoids to the north and enlist them in his own
    armies.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="celene" />
    <legend-link>Kingdom of Celene</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    This small land west of the Wild Coast beyond the Welkwood has long been under the rule of
    Olvenfolk. Although these are good creatures, they do not welcome strangers (with cause), and
    little certain knowledge of Celene or its Court exists. The realm is friendly with the Ulek
    states, and an alliance between Celene and these countries was responsible for the campaigns
    which drove all of the humanoids from the Lortmil Mountains – although the defeated forces of
    humanoids subsequently invaded and took over the Pomarj. A small number of humans and
    half-elvenfolk dwell in Celene, many serving in its military, for continual warfare is carried
    on (in the Suss Forest and beyond the Jewel River) with the
    <legend-link>Pomarj</legend-link> humanoid tribes.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="dyvers" />
    <legend-link>Free and Independent City of Dyvers</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Dyvers’ position at the mouth of the Velverdyva River on the coast of the Lake of Unknown Depths
    (Nyr Dyv) makes it an important trading center and busy port, with lake and river traffic from
    as far away as Perrenland, Bissel, Nyrond, Urnst, the Pale, Tenh, and even occasional missions
    from Iuz. The city was originally a part of the Viceroyalty of Ferrond and contributed heavily
    in money, goods, and men to the war which saw the institution of the Kingdom of Furyondy.
    Because of the alliance and close ties with Veluna, whose policies the Gentry of Dyvers see as
    restrictive, the city declared its independence in 526 CY, King Thrommel II allowing this act to
    pass unchallenged. Dyvers claims some 2,000 square miles of land, including the islands at the
    mouth of the Velverdyva, as its sovereign territory – although the Magisters have been careful
    not to claim any of the land on the north band of the river. The free city boasts a marine force
    of 1,000 men and an army twice as numerous. These troops are very well armed and equipped.

  <p>
    Ekbir is the strongest city of the Bakluni in the Flanaess. Founded by survivors of the Invoked
    Devastation, the small port quickly grew into a place for nomads’ goods as well. The original
    village grew into a walled town, and town grew into thriving city. Ekbir controls a sizable
    territory and has a large war fleet. Her forces consist principally of light and medium cavalry,
    although there are 1,000 heavy foot in her standing army, which is reported to number some 5,000
    soldiers.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="frost-barbarians" />
    <legend-link>Frost Barbarians (Fruztii)</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Frost Barbarians are the weakest of the three nations (of Suel peoples) inhabiting the
    Thillonrian Peninsula, called Rhizia by these peoples. They have never recovered from the Battle
    of Shamblefield, and have been under the suzerainty of the Schnai for the past two decades – and
    several times previously as well. The supposed figurehead placed upon the throne of the Fruztii
    has, however, built his kingdom carefully, and in actuality it is now independent in all but
    oath. A recent pact concluded between Fruztii and Ratik saw a joint army wreak havoc in the Bone
    March, and during the next campaigning season clear the north pass of the “Fists” (see Hold of
    Stonefist).
  </p>

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="kingdom-furyondy" />
    <legend-link>Kingdom of Furyondy</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Viceroyalty of Ferrond was founded upon several small states during the height of Aerdian
    power (c. 100 CY). It was aimed at giving the Great Kingdom a strong satrapy on the western
    frontier from which further conquest could be launched. The Viceroy ruled from the Clatspur
    Mountains to the Nyr Dyv, from the Lortmils in the south to the far shores of Whyestil Lake, and
    beyond, in the north. As the power of the Malachite Throne in Rauxes waned (c. 200 CY), the
    viceroys of Ferrond ruled more by their own writ and less by the leave of the Aerdi overlords.
    In 898 O.R. the heir to Viceroy Stinvri (the Viceroyalty had become hereditary some years
    previously) was crowned in Dyvers as Thrommel I, King of Furyondy, Prince of Veluna, Provost of
    the Northern Reaches, Warden General of the Vesve Forest, Marshall of the Shield Lands, Lord of
    Dyvers, etc. The adjunctive states were soon lost, but the central core of the kingdom was sound
    and viable and has persisted. Belvor IV is a most noble and just king, and his realm is closely
    allied with that of Veluna, constantly warring upon the evil Horned Society and Iuz, as well as
    lending contingents to expeditions mounted by the Earl of the Shield Lands against the Bandit
    Kingdoms. Furyondy’s belled heavy cavalry is famous throughout the Flanaess, as are their light
    infantry units drawn from the Vesve Forest. The standing army of the kingdom numbers only a few
    thousand, but noble and militia contingents swell its numbers to 20,000 or more in rime of need.
    The Furyondian fleet upon the Whyestil absolutely commands that body of water, and there also is
    a Furyondian squadron upon the Nyr Dyv, sailing from its base at Willip. The kingdom’s colors
    are blue and red stripes.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="grand-duchy-geoff" />
    <legend-link>Grand Duchy of Geoff</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The isolated position of Geoff, surrounded on all sides by mountains, hills, and forests, has
    made it virtually immune to the normal warfare of the Flanaess – although at one time a brief
    conflict with Keoland was fought (c. 450 CY). Rushmoor forms the nominal eastern boundary of the
    realm. The inhabitants of the Grand Duchy are of Flan-Suel-Oerid mixture, seemingly combining
    the best features of each race. This is fortunate, as they are continually threatened by
    incursions of formidable ogres and giants coming down the Crystalmists. The Geoffites dwell in
    harmony with the olvenfolk in the realm, and these two peoples often combine to combat the
    invading monsters. The Grand Duke, Owen I, is a clever and valorous leader, on friendly terms
    with the Earl of Sterich and the King of Keoland alike. The forces of the Grand Duke include
    horse, bowmen, and contingents of pikemen from the mountain holdings.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="gran-march" />
    <legend-link>Gran March</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Keoland established the territory of the Gran March during its early stages, basing it upon a
    military-religious order of knights. These zealous fighters quickly subdued the warring
    inhabitants, established order within the area, and conscripted all fit males into worker and
    infantry battles (regimental-like formations). The land between the Lortmils and Dim Forest
    north of the Sheldomar became productive and peaceful, but the rule of these first Commandants
    was repressive and harsh. When Berlikyn, then ruler of the fief, was slain in combat in the war
    with Veluna-Furyondy in the Small War, the populace rose in rejoicing. Keoland reconsidered its
    policies thereafter, and allowed the people to elect their own Commandant from amongst the noble
    houses of Gran March. The state is now only a nominal vassal of Keoland and maintains friendly
    relations with Bissel. The army of the Commandant relies primarily upon its mailed cavalry
    -medium horse armed with lance, crossbow, and sword.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="great-kingdom" />
    <legend-link>Great Kingdom of Aerdy</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    The history of the Great Kingdom is too well known to dwell upon here. Once the most powerful
    force for order and good, the Aerdians have declined over the last century to an unspeakable
    state of decadency. After a millennium of leadership, its rulers and nobles turned to evil and
    irrationality. Its current monarch, Ivid V of the royal house of Naelax, is reported to be quite
    mad, but crafty and deviously capable nonetheless. His writ extends to the Royal Demesne
    surrounding the capital, the Grandwood, and further only by threat and persuasion of the Peers
    whose fiefs comprise the balance of the realm. The Overking’s Companion Guard consists of 10
    select companies of various arms (heavy, medium, and light cavalry, crossbowmen, archers, and
    five companies of pole armed foot).
  </p>
  <p>
    Noble contingents allow the Overking to field an army numbering over 15,000 troops in a
    relatively short time, and if necessary a force of four or five times that can be called up.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both the North and South Provinces are under the suzerainty of Aerdi royal houses and are ruled
    almost as independent states. The troubles in the Bone March have caused the Herzog of the North
    to fall into line, as the difficulties with the Iron League brought his southern counterpart
    into closer cooperation with the Malachite Throne (see North Province, South Province, and also
    See of Medegia.) The Sea Barons pay a token tribute to the Overking and conduct their piratical
    operations under letters of marque bearing the Overking’s Seal.

  <h2>
    <heraldry-icon name="greyhawk" />
    <legend-link>Free City of Greyhawk</legend-link>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Greyhawk was established as a trading post on the Selintan River during the period of early
    migrations. As it flourished, a local warlord built a small keep on the hills above the village
    called Greyhawk which had sprung up around the trading center, extracting taxes from the trade
    and occasionally raiding caravans (particularly those coming with silver ingots found in the
    burial mounds of the Cairn Hills). This petty noble soon became quite rich and powerful and
    assumed the title of Landgraf of Selintan. Greyhawk and the power of the new Landgraf grew
    rapidly thereafter, and his son and heir, Ganz, was wed to the daughter of the Gynarch
    (Despotrix) of Hardby, a sorceress of no small repute. Their descendants ruled a growing domain
    which rose to considerable heights c. 375 CY under the rule of Zagig Yragerne (the so-called Mad
    Archmage). It was Zagig who built the sprawling Castle Greyhawk (now a ruin) and poured funds
    into the City of Greyhawk in order to make it into the “Gem of the Flanaess.” His reign was
    bizarre in many other ways, and it came as no surprise when it was reported that Zagig Yragerne
    had mysteriously vanished after years of rule when no change or aging could be detected. The
    castle was abandoned, supposedly due to a terrible curse upon the place, but the City proper
    continued to flourish. In 498 CY it was proclaimed a free and independent city, ruling a
    territory from Hardby on the Woolly bay to the Nyr Dyv, between the eastern folds of the Cairn
    Hills and the Gnarley forest, including much of what is now the northern section of the Wild
    Coast region. These holdings have been lost over the intervening decades, and a decline in trade
    seemed certain to turn the place into a backwater, save for recent events. Several years ago a
    series of treasure troves was discovered in or near Greyhawk Castle. Immense wealth began
    flowing into the city, and artisans and mercenaries began flocking to Greyhawk due to this boom.
    Local lords used this influx of hard money to revitalize the city, and it again rules a
    considerable portion of the area, claiming all of the land from Nyr Dyv to the Neen River where
    it Joins the Selintan, including the mines in the Cairn Hills. The Despotrix of Hardby now pays
    tribute to Greyhawk to avoid being absorbed in the growing city state once again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Greyhawk is ruled by its Lord Mayor; this individual is chosen by the Directing Oligarchy. The
    latter body is composed of the Captain-General of the Watch, the Constable, the Guildmaster of
    Thieves, the Guildmaster of Assassins, and various representatives of the Society of Magi, the
    Merchants and Traders Union, Artisans League, and Clerical leaders. The total number of the
    Directors ranges from 12 to 18.

  <h3><legend-link>Independent Town Of Highfolk</legend-link></h3>
  <p>
    Highfolk is independent and of importance simply because it is the southern outpost of the
    Olvenfolk of the Quagflow Valley (the Fairdells in Olven). The town itself is a trading center
    and home to some 2,000 humankind. It is well fortified and protects the homeland – the 100-mile
    stretch of valley above, which lies between the southern arm of the Yatils and the Vesve Forest
    to the east. There are many thorps set in beautiful dales along the banks of the river, and the
    Lord of the High Elves dwells in the region, along with some 10,000 of his kin and numerous
    Sylvan Elves as well (the latter in the fringes of the Vesve on the east bank). The folk of
    Highfolk and the valley above are at peace with their neighbors to the north and south. The more
    restless sometimes take service with mercenary bands of Perrenlander soldiery.
  </p>
  <h3><legend-link>Valley of the Velverdyva</legend-link></h3>
  <p>
    As related above for the independent town of the same name, Highfolk is principally an elven
    realm. The humans dwelling along the 100 miles of the valley are woodsmen who live in harmony
    with their demi-human fellows, or hillmen who are allies of the gnomes. The Lord of the High
    Elves is deferred to as the nominal ruler, but this is through general consent and respect. The
    word of the Gnome prince, a village Elder, or the Earl of a community of Sylvan Elves is
    listened to with as much respect. All the peoples of Highfolk Valley are independent and
    free-spirited. However, in time of need, they are able to muster a considerable body of
    fighters, including humans armed with longbows and many sorts of demi-human troops. The Knights
    of the Hart of Highfolk are drawn from the best of the elven and half-elven warriors of the
    valley region. The main enemies of the people of Highfolk come from the land of Iuz, penetrating
    the Vesve Forest.

    Originally a stronghold of the more organized of the humanoid tribes, the area came under the
    rule of a group of evil humans some decades ago. It is speculated that these wicked people were
    disaffected bandits or were at least aided by one or more of the bandit kinglets. In any case,
    the land between the Veng and Ritensa Rivers as far north as the territory of the Rovers of the
    Barrens is now firmly in the grasp of the Horned Society. This association combines the masses
    of humanoid troops with the organization and powers of humans. Deviltry is the religion of the
    Society, and its leading Hierarch is purported to be an evil high priest. Other leaders are
    reported as a powerful wizard, several other powerful clerics, a master rogue, and a trio of
    fighter Lords. It is known that many troops of bandits from the east frequent the walled town of

    The Ice Barbarians inhabit the bleak shores of the Thillonrian Peninsula’s north and east

    them into Ratik or the more tempting Great Kingdom. In high summer they often find fighting by
    rounding the coasts of the Hold of Stonefist, and the Cruskii have both hatred and respect for
    the dour inhabitants of that land. Their most despised enemy, however, is the Sea Barons, whose
    ships they attack on sight, and whose isles they often attack and plunder – usually at a price.
    Of late these raiders have joined with Frost and Snow barbarians in order to counter the growing

    This large and thriving city is based on sea commerce and trade between Onnwal and the East.
    lrongate developed an independent spirit early in its history due to its mingling of peoples and
    ideas. As the rule of the Overking grew more despotic, the people of the city began to murmur,
    and the Lord Mayor headed a deputation bearing grievances to the Herzog. These emissaries were
    thrown into prison, given a mock trial, and executed by ritual torture for the Overking’s
    entertainment (446 CY). The following year the whole of the south was in arms against the realm,
    and after a brief struggle the Iron League was founded, an alliance of mutual support which
    aided the rebellious states to throw off the yoke of the Aerdi tyrants. lrongate has a strong
    naval squadron and a large company of armored crossbowmen in League service. She can also raise

    policy of conquest. At the peak of this imperialism, Keoland held sway from the
    <legend-link>Pomarj</legend-link> to the <legend-link>Crystalmist Mountains</legend-link>, while
    her armies pushed into <legend-link>Ket</legend-link> and threatened
    <legend-link>Verbobonc</legend-link> and <legend-link>Veluna City</legend-link> (c. 350-360 CY).
    The Ketite expedition came to grief in successive battles (<legend-link>Molvar</legend-link>,
    <legend-link>Lopolla</legend-link>), while an alliance between
    <legend-link>Veluna</legend-link>-<a href="#kingdom-furyondy">Furyondy</a> ended the Keoish
    threat in that quarter (<em>Short War</em>) Coincidentally, the Olvenfolk within the boundaries
    of Keoland objected to the warlike policies of the King and began expelling royal garrisons in
    the <legend-link>Ulek</legend-link> Provinces and <legend-link>Celene</legend-link>. In the
    ensuing struggle, the freemen of the western portion sided with the demi-humans. Raiders in the
    far south took advantage of these conditions to harry the Keoish coast from
    <legend-link>Gradsul</legend-link> to <legend-link>Gryrax</legend-link>.

    <em>King Tavish III</em> was slain in battle against the
    <legend-link>Sea Princes</legend-link> (Siege of <legend-link>Westkeep</legend-link>, 453 CY),
    and his son, <em>Tavish IV</em>, immediately changed the policies of the kingdom upon ascending
    to the throne. After protracted negotiations, the independent state of the
    <legend-link>Yeomanry</legend-link> was recognized, the Ulek states were granted autonomy, and
    Keoland returned to its former state of tolerance and prosperity thereafter. The
    semi-independent <legend-link>Gran March</legend-link> and Earldom of
    <legend-link>Sterich</legend-link> are loyal to the crown and furnish strong contingents to the
    royal army. The Keolanders are well-known for their light cavalry employing javelins, crossbows,
    and lances. The bulk of the army consists of foot armed with pole arms and long spears, while
    the nobility comprises the heavy cavalry portion of the force. There are typically small
    companies of elves, gnomes, halflings, and/or dwarves included in muster. The fleet is
    battleworthy but small, and conflict with the <legend-link>Sea Princes</legend-link> continues
    to plague the realm.

    The buccaneers of the <legend-link>Azure Sea</legend-link> and
    <legend-link>Jeklea Bay</legend-link> grew strong and wealthy when
    <legend-link>Keoland</legend-link> was at the height of its power, for the eyes of its leaders
    were turned northwards towards empire, and the sea raiders were ignored. These privateers took
    to calling themselves <em>Sea Princes</em>, after a particularly successful captain who was in
    fact of noble birth. Sailing unchecked from their island and mainland strongholds, these raiders
    were the scourge of the coasts from <legend-link>Gradsul</legend-link> to
    <legend-link>Scant</legend-link>, on the <legend-link>Pomarj</legend-link>, and even beyond into
    the <legend-link>Sea of Gearnat</legend-link> and the <legend-link>Tilva Strait</legend-link>.
    When <legend-link>Keoland</legend-link> turned back from imperial expansion, her navy began to
    rebuild in order to check the threat of the Sea Princes — as they were now commonly known. Their
    numbers and strength had become so great, however, that the Keoish fleet, even with the aid of a
    squadron of <legend-link>Ulek</legend-link> warships, could at best deliver a sharp check to
    them (<em>Battle of <legend-link>Jetsom Island</legend-link></em
    >). This lesson caused their leaders to rethink their policies, however, and several of the
    wiser captains retired to mainland estates, appointing lieutenants to command their ships, not
    in piratical or raiding activities in the <em>Flanaess</em>, but on expeditions to the
    <legend-link>Amedio Coasts</legend-link> and thence to trade northwards with the rare woods,
    spices, ivory, and gold which they wrested from the jungle savages. Eventually the mainland
    possessions of the Sea Princes amounted to more territory than their island homes, and they
    practiced little formal raiding. Today they are still probably the strongest sea power, but they
    also have a small and efficient army and are relatively peaceful traders. If these people have a
    fault, it is that they allow the use of slaves in their nation, despite strong protests from the
    <legend-link>Yeomanry</legend-link>. It is reported that the Prince of
    <legend-link>Monmurg</legend-link> would abolish this practice, but his fellow nobles (the
    Prince of <legend-link>Toli</legend-link>, the Plar of <legend-link>Hool</legend-link>, and the
    Grandee of <legend-link>Westkeep</legend-link>, along with the Commodores of
    <legend-link>Jetsom</legend-link>, <legend-link>Fairwind</legend-link>, and
    <legend-link>Flotsom</legend-link>) prevent it.
