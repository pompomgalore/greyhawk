  <h3><a href="#prelacy-almor">Prelacy of Almor</a></h3>
  <p>
    Originally a clerical fief of <a href="#great-kingdom">Aerdy</a>, Almor grew in power and
    independence as the <a href="#great-kingdom">Great Kingdom</a> became weak and decadent. The
    various petty nobles and the Lord Mayor of the town of <a href="#innspa">Innspa</a> swear
    allegiance to the reigning prelate - usually a high priest. The state is only loosely organized,
    but it has a strong spirit of freedom and justice based upon religious precepts. The peoples are
    mainly farmers, herdsmen, fisherfolk, and in the far north, some foresters. Militia contingents
    bear crossbows, spears, polearms (fauchard or glaive most commonly), or longbows, and battleaxes
    for the northern contingent. Standing forces number around 5,000 total horse and foot, plus the
    nobility and gentry. The Prelacy is strongly supported by <a href="#nyrond">Nyrond</a> as a
    buffer between that realm and the <em>Overking</em>'s, and pays a stipend to help support the
    standing army of Almor.

  <h3><a href="#kingdom-keoland">Kingdom of Keoland</a></h3>
  <p>
    Keoland was the first major kingdom to be established in the <em>Flanaess</em>, the Oeridians
    and Suloise tribes mingling and joining to build a tolerant and prosperous realm, which
    nominally included many and varied demi-human groups as well. After several centuries of benign
    leadership, a line of monarchs upon the Keoish Throne became ambitious and embarked upon a
    policy of conquest. At the peak of this imperialism, Keoland held sway from the
    <a href="#pomarj">Pomarj</a> to the <em>Crystalmist Mountains</em>, while her armies pushed into
    <a href="#ket">Ket</a> and threatened <a href="#verbobonc">Verbobonc</a> and
    <a href="#veluna-city">Veluna City</a> (c. 350-360 CY).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ketite expedition came to grief in successive battles (<em>Molvar</em>,
    <a href="#lopolla">Lopolla</a>), while an alliance between <a href="#veluna">Veluna</a> and
    <a href="#kingdom-furyondy">Furyondy</a> ended the Keoish threat in that quarter (<em
      >Short War</em
    >). Coincidentally, the Olvenfolk within the boundaries of Keoland objected to the warlike
    policies of the King and began expelling royal garrisons in the <em>Ulek</em> Provinces (<a
      href="#county-ulek"
      >Ulek County</a
    >, <a href="#duchy-ulek">Ulek Duchy</a>, <a href="#principality-ulek">Ulek Principality</a>) and
    <a href="#celene">Celene</a>. In the ensuing struggle, the freemen of the western portion sided
    with the demi-humans. Raiders in the far south took advantage of these conditions to harry the
    Keoish coast from <a href="#gradsul">Gradsul</a> to <a href="#gryrax">Gryrax</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>King Tavish III</em> was slain in battle against the
    <a href="#hold-sea-princes">Sea Princes</a> (Siege of <a href="#westkeep">Westkeep</a>, 453 CY),
    and his son, <em>Tavish IV</em>, immediately changed the policies of the kingdom upon ascending
    to the throne. After protracted negotiations, the independent state of the
    <a href="#yeomanry">Yeomanry</a> was recognized, the Ulek states were granted autonomy, and
    Keoland returned to its former state of tolerance and prosperity thereafter. The
    semi-independent <a href="#gran-march">Gran March</a> and Earldom of
    <a href="#sterich">Sterich</a> are loyal to the crown and furnish strong contingents to the
    royal army.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Keolanders are well-known for their light cavalry employing javelins, crossbows, and lances.
    The bulk of the army consists of foot armed with pole arms and long spears, while the nobility
    comprises the heavy cavalry portion of the force. There are typically small companies of elves,
    gnomes, halflings, and/or dwarves included in muster. The fleet is battleworthy but small, and
    conflict with the <a href="#hold-sea-princes">Sea Princes</a> continues to plague the realm.

    The buccaneers of the <a href="#azure-sea">Azure Sea</a> and
    <a href="#jeklea-bay">Jeklea Bay</a> grew strong and wealthy when
    <a href="#kingdom-keoland">Keoland</a> was at the height of its power, for the eyes of its
    leaders were turned northwards towards empire, and the sea raiders were ignored. These
    privateers took to calling themselves <em>Sea Princes</em>, after a particularly successful
    captain who was, in fact, of noble birth. Sailing unchecked from their island and mainland
    strongholds, these raiders were the scourge of the coasts from <a href="#gradsul">Gradsul</a> to
    <a href="#scant">Scant</a>, on the <a href="#pomarj">Pomarj</a>, and even beyond into the
    <a href="#sea-gearnat">Sea of Gearnat</a> and the <a href="#tilva-strait">Tilva Strait</a>. When
    <a href="#kingdom-keoland">Keoland</a> turned back from imperial expansion, her navy began to
    rebuild to check the threat of the Sea Princes, as they were now commonly known. Their numbers
    and strength had become so great, however, that the Keoish fleet, even with the aid of a
    squadron of <em>Ulek</em> warships, could at best deliver a sharp check to them (<em
      >Battle of Jetsom Island</em
    >). This lesson caused their leaders to rethink their policies, and several of the wiser
    captains retired to mainland estates, appointing lieutenants to command their ships. Not in
    piratical or raiding activities in the <em>Flanaess</em>, but on expeditions to the
    <a href="#amedio-jungle">Amedio Jungle</a> coasts and then to trade northwards with the rare
    woods, spices, ivory, and gold, which they wrested from the jungle savages. Eventually, the
    mainland possessions of the <a href="#hold-sea-princes">Sea Princes</a> amounted to more
    territory than their island homes, and they practiced little formal raiding. Today they are
    still probably the strongest sea power, but they also have a small and efficient army and are
    relatively peaceful traders. If these people have a fault, it is that they allow the use of
    slaves in their nation, despite strong protests from the <a href="#yeomanry">Yeomanry</a>. It is
    reported that the Prince of <a href="#monmurg">Monmurg</a> would abolish this practice, but his
    fellow nobles (the Prince of <a href="#port-toli">Toli</a>, the Plar of
    <a href="#hool">Hool</a>, and the Grandee of <a href="#westkeep">Westkeep</a>, along with the
    Commodores of <a href="#jetsom-island">Jetsom</a>, <a href="#fairwind-isle">Fairwind</a>, and
    <a href="#flotsom-island">Flotsom</a>) prevent it.
