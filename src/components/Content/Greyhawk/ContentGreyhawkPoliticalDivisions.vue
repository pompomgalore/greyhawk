  <p>
    Keoland was the first major kingdom to be established in the <em>Flanaess</em>, the Oeridians
    and Suloise tribes mingling and joining to build a tolerant and prosperous realm, which
    nominally included many and varied demi-human groups as well. After several centuries of benign
    leadership, a line of monarchs upon the Keoish Throne became ambitious and embarked upon a
    policy of conquest. At the peak of this imperialism, Keoland held sway from the
    <a href="#pomarj">Pomarj</a> to the <em>Crystalmist Mountains</em>, while her armies pushed into
    <a href="#ket">Ket</a> and threatened <a href="#verbobonc">Verbobonc</a> and
    <a href="#veluna-city">Veluna City</a> (c. 350-360 CY).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Ketite expedition came to grief in successive battles (<em>Molvar</em>,
    <a href="#lopolla">Lopolla</a>), while an alliance between <a href="#veluna">Veluna</a> and
    <a href="#kingdom-furyondy">Furyondy</a> ended the Keoish threat in that quarter (<em
      >Short War</em
    >). Coincidentally, the Olvenfolk within the boundaries of Keoland objected to the warlike
    policies of the King and began expelling royal garrisons in the <em>Ulek</em> Provinces (<a
      href="#county-ulek"
      >Ulek County</a
    >, <a href="#duchy-ulek">Ulek Duchy</a>, <a href="#principality-ulek">Ulek Principality</a>) and
    <a href="#celene">Celene</a>. In the ensuing struggle, the freemen of the western portion sided
    with the demi-humans. Raiders in the far south took advantage of these conditions to harry the
    Keoish coast from <a href="#gradsul">Gradsul</a> to <a href="#gryrax">Gryrax</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>King Tavish III</em> was slain in battle against the
    <a href="#hold-sea-princes">Sea Princes</a> (Siege of <a href="#westkeep">Westkeep</a>, 453 CY),
    and his son, <em>Tavish IV</em>, immediately changed the policies of the kingdom upon ascending
    to the throne. After protracted negotiations, the independent state of the
    <a href="#yeomanry">Yeomanry</a> was recognized, the Ulek states were granted autonomy, and
    Keoland returned to its former state of tolerance and prosperity thereafter. The
    semi-independent <a href="#gran-march">Gran March</a> and Earldom of
    <a href="#sterich">Sterich</a> are loyal to the crown and furnish strong contingents to the
    royal army.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Keolanders are well-known for their light cavalry employing javelins, crossbows, and lances.
    The bulk of the army consists of foot armed with pole arms and long spears, while the nobility
    comprises the heavy cavalry portion of the force. There are typically small companies of elves,
    gnomes, halflings, and/or dwarves included in muster. The fleet is battleworthy but small, and
    conflict with the <a href="#hold-sea-princes">Sea Princes</a> continues to plague the realm.
